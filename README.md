### Abstract
Web users who searches for information via a search engine have very less insights about the IQ of Web documents. We trained a multiple output regression for the task of estimating the Informa- tion Quality (IQ) of Web documents based on historical data where features and assessments where collected. For retrieving the IQ scores we automatically collect their features and predict the IQ based on the patterns that our algorithm learned. The model for semi-automatically assessing the IQ of Web documents was in- spired by the work of Ceolin et al. Compared to their framework our Framework is also capable of retrieving documents inherent a given topic of interest to the user in a comparable manner, we provide descriptive insight about the content of the Web document and we increased the responsivity of the information.
